## **üöÄ¬†App Ideas (choose one)**

You must implement one of the following app ideas.
You are encouraged to extend or refine the core idea if you wish, but you **must deliver a fully working basic version** within the 6-hour timebox.

- **Selected: Recipe Manager**
  Add recipes with title, ingredients, steps, and optionally upload an image.

## **üèÅ¬†Deliverables**

- **Planning Outputs**
  Share your UX diagrams/flows Drawio and md files.
- **Codebase**

  Solution developed in a framework you are comfortable with (NextJS & Tailwind preferred).
  You are not required to use a database for the challenge. An in memory JSON object for data storage is sufficient.
  You are not required to implement user authentication for the challenge. A single user experience is sufficient.
  Code should be hosted on a public GitHub repo.

- **README file:**
  - Setup instructions included in your GitHub repo
  - Short explanation of your architecture/design choices
  - Anything you would improve with more time
